# Tulipz
A project for understanding C++ dev pipeline for desktop applications with GUI and Image Editing focus

The project will be explored in levels. As each level is achieved, the goals of future levels will 

LEVEL 1: Basic Window
Create cpp file and compile with G++ using Windows SDK to make basic window Menus, Buttons, and Dialogue Boxes. Explore Fullscreen, Windowed Fullscreen and Windowed Display methods; also locked Window sizes, scalable windows. 

LEVEL 2: Basic Input
Text editors, mouse tracking canvases, color pickers, and program associated file types/extensions. (this is probably more advanced than Level 2 and should be moved later)

LEVEL 3: Drawing on Canvas
Creates a canvas of specific size, and can draw single pixels onto blank canvas. Open common image file types and edit image with pen tool.
Pen, Eraser, Selection, Bucket, Color Picker.
...
From here plan a fundamental logic of how to store input and interpret image files and custom file types.
